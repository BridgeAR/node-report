# nodereport

nodereport is an add-on for Node.js, delivered as an NPM module,
which provides a human-readable diagnostic summary report, written
to file. The report is intended for development, test and production
use, to capture and preserve information for problem determination.
It includes Javascript and native stack traces, heap statistics,
platform information and resource usage etc. With the report enabled,
reports are triggered on unhandled exceptions, fatal errors, signals
and calls to a Javascript API.
